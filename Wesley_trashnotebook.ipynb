    "\n",
    "This script is pulling the parts of speech (POS) for each word in each clean_text file. It places it into a list, then makes that list into a set to get rid of duplicates. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am not satisfied with its accuracy. It is taking guesses, but needs refinement. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this section is to provide some preliminary coding experimentation along the lines of identifying POS that we can incorporate into the \"concept\" search later. The Concept Search is only pulling synonyms of the search term at the moment. This is pulling in all synonyms, even those which may be out of context for the concept and the sentence. My belief is that in order to pull concepts, the synonyms must equal the part of speech that the search_term occupies. Also, I believe that the Concept Search must take into account the words around the synonym. For example, when I do a concept search for the word 'violence', the concept search is not taking into account positive and negative adjectives associated with the synonyms of 'violence'. This is a refinement area. "
